* Farsi Translation

- We started with a machine translation of the /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL

- That was then fixed up based on /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL.he right-to-left markings.

- The translated text was reviewed, improved and re-written for clarity and ease of reading.

* Arabic Translation

- We started with a machine translation of the /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL

- That was then fixed up based on /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL.he right-to-left markings.

- TODO the translated text needs to be reviewed by many for clarity and ease of reading.
