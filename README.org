* General

The English origignal text is a symlink as:

#+begin_src sh
ln -s /usr/local/share/emacs/29/etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL emacs/TUTORIAL
#+end_src

The Hebrew version is a  symlink as:

#+begin_src sh
ln -s /usr/local/share/emacs/29/etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL.he emacs/TUTORIAL.he
#+end_src

TUTORIAL.he is being refered to for consistency of right-to-left languages

* Farsi Translation

- We started with a machine translation of the /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL

- That was then fixed up based on /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL.he for right-to-left markings.

- The translated text re-written for clarity and ease of reading.

* Arabic Translation

- We started with a machine translation of the /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL

- That was then fixed up based on /etc/tutorials/TUTORIAL.he right-to-left markings.

- TODO the translated text needs to be reviewed by many for clarity and ease of reading.
